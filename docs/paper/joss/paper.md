# Summary

The `MFEM/MGIS` application aims to efficiently use supercomputers in
order to describe coupled multiphysics phenomena with a particular focus
on thermo-mechanics. The authors primarily aim at describing the
nuclear fuels at mesoscale (see example below), but `MFEM/MGIS` is
versatile and can address more general cases.

This open-source library is based on several components as
prerequisites: the `MFEM` (Modular Finite Element Methods) [@mfem;
@mfem-web] library, the `MGIS` (MFront Generic Interface Support)
[@Helfer2020] library and the `MFront` code generator
[@helfer2015introducing].

Thanks to the features embedded within `MGIS` and `MFront` and thanks to
specific developments, `MFEM/MGIS` adds several mechanical features
compared to a pure MFEM approach. The library tackles some peculiarities
of nonlinear mechanics. In particular, the support of complex
constitutive laws and the management of advanced boundary conditions.

# MFEM-based Thermo-Mechanical Solver for Nuclear Fuel Simulations

`MFEM`, is a finite element library designed for current supercomputers
but also for the upcoming exascale supercomputers. It provides many
useful features for carrying out realistic simulations: support for
curvilinear meshes, high order approximation spaces and different
families of finite elements, interfaces to several types of parallel
solvers (including matrix-free ones), preconditioners, and native
support for adaptive non-conforming mesh refinement (AMR).

Originating from the applied mathematics and parallel computing
communities, `MFEM` offers both performance and a large panel of
advanced mathematical features. In particular, one can easily switch
from one linear solver to another (direct or iterative), which is
essential for the targeted application [@bernaud2024pleiades]:
microstructure and mesoscale modeling for nuclear fuel.

# Statement of need

The solid mechanic applications in `MFEM` are mostly limited to simple
constitutive equations such as elasticity and hyperelasticity, which is
insufficient to address complex nuclear fuel simulations.

The aim of `MFEM/MGIS` project is to combine `MFEM` with the
`MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport` (`MGIS`) project, an open-source `C++`
library handles all the kinds of behavior supported by the open-source
`MFront` code generator.

In the field of nonlinear mechanics, this encompasses arbitrary complex
behaviors that can describe damage, plasticity, viscoplasticity, phase
change in both small or finite strain analyses. Generalized behaviors
such as variational approaches to fracture are supported
by `MFEM/MGIS`.

Also, contrary to non linear forms provided natively by `MFEM`,
`MFEM/MGIS` allows to assign distinct behaviors to each material. The
`MGIS` data structures are also used to add support for partial
quadrature functions to `MFEM`, a feature needed to store internal state
variables on each material.

<!--
Strongly coupled thermo-mechanical behaviors and Cosserat media can be
introduced by plugins and will be integrated in future versions of
`MFEM/MGIS`.

# Overview of `MFEM/MGIS` features

## User interface

The `MFEM/MGIS` library is written in `C++17` language.

As the application targets mechanical engineers, it provides a high level
of abstraction, focused on the physical aspects of the simulation and
hiding most numerical details by default.

The main class of `MFEM/MGIS` is called `NonLinearEvolutionProblem` and
describes the evolution of the materials of the physical system
of interest over a single time step for a given phenomenon: currently
`MFEM/MGIS` provides built-in support for mechanics, heat transfer, and
micromorphic damage are supported.

A staggered approach for multiphysics simulations can be set up by using
several instances of `NonLinearEvolutionProblem`.

The API is declarative and mostly based on data structures similar to a
`python` dictionary, limiting direct usage of `C++`. In particular, this
data structure is used to instantiate post-processings and boundary
conditions through abstract factories.

<!--

This data structure can be read from a `JSON`-file allowing to create
domain-specific applications.

-->

## Post-processings

Various post-processings are available:

- `ComputeResultantForceOnBoundary`: Compute the resultant of the inner
  forces on a boundary.
- `ComputeMeanThermodynamicForcesValues`: Compute the macroscopic stress
  and strain for each material.
- `ParaviewExportIntegrationPointResultsAtNodes`: Paraview post
  processing files of partial quadrature functions, like the ones
  associated with the internal state variables.

## Tutorials

These features are described in the following tutorial:
<https://thelfer.github.io/mfem-mgis/tutorial.html>.

Several examples can be found on the open-source GitHub repository:
<https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples>, including simulation of
the microstructural scale using a Representative Volume Element (RVE) of
nuclear fuel.

## Plugins

Post-processings and boundary conditions are instantiated through
abstract factories. Those abstract factories allow to extend `MFEM/MGIS`
through plugins.

## Software stack and installation process

![MFEM/MGIS Stack. Each library is open source.\label{fig:SoftStack}](./MMM-stack-v0.png "MFEM/MGIS software stack. MFEM/MGIS is the convergence between two open sources ecosytem."){width=75%}

The MFEM/MGIS software stack is illustrated in \autoref{fig:SoftStack}.
Hence, the minimal package requirements to build MFEM/MGIS on
a HPC platform is typically:`C++17`, `MFEM`, `MGIS`, `TFEL`(MFront),
CMake and `MPI`. It is important to note that `MFEM` includes a significant stack of several tens packages including linear solver libraries.
To handle the numerous accessible combinations, `Spack`
[@gamblin2015spack] is really a cornerstone. This package manager
simplifies building, installing, customizing, and sharing HPC software
stacks. In the end, `MFEM-MGIS` offers a `Spack`
package reusing most of the `MFEM` installation variants already provided in
the `MFEM` `Spack` package while maintaining compatibility across package versions.

# Integrate MFEM/MGIS in an Open Source Ecosystem

The `MFEM/MGIS` library takes full advantage of an open-source software
(OSS) stack. It benefits from the increasing maturity of several
scientific tools that are combined.

Thus, within `MFEM`, one has many available choices to set the linear
solver, such as: `Hypre`[@hypre2002], `PETSc`[@petsc-web-page],
`MUMPS`[@mumps], `SuperLU`, `UMFPACK`[@davis2004algorithm] or other
ones. Likewise, several preconditioners, partitioning libraries, or
input mesh formats can be activated and used.

Combinations are highly configurable and almost all external libraries
that relates to linear solvers are switchable.

# Numerical Results {#sec:numerical_results}

Installation and deployment on desktop or large computers is shortened
using the Spack package manager. Multi-material elastic modelling on
computational clusters has been carried out with `MFEM/MGIS`. The
observed scalability performance is good on a few thousands of CPU
cores. Benchmarks are available in the documentation: <https://thelfer.github.io/mfem-mgis/benchmark.html>.

Despite the very high level of abstraction and the genericness of
`MFEM/MGIS` (multi-material and arbitrary behaviors), the overhead
appears reasonably limited. In the worst-case for `MFEM/MGIS`, an
overhead of up to 30% has been observed compared to a pure `MFEM`
version which provides very optimized and specialized kernels (the test
was performed on a simulation with only two elastic materials).

Several examples can be found on the open-source GitHub repository:
<https://github.com/latug0/mfem-mgis-examples>.

# Conclusion

This paper presents the `MFEM/MGIS` HPC application designed to address
large scale thermo-mechanical simulation and recent supercomputers.
Based on an open source software stack, it allows for the fine
representation of microstructure in full 3D in the field of fuel
modeling.

On the one hand, `MGIS` and `MFront` bring support for complex
nonlinear behaviours such as damage, plasticity, viscoplasticity
capabilities. On the other hand, `MFEM` provides advanced finite
element schemes and parallel performance (tested on several thousands
of cores until now). 
<!--

Regarding performance portability on GPUs, MFEM already offers numerous
algorithms such as partial assembly on GPUs, but MFEM/MGIS does not
exploit these features yet. Work is underway to port behavior laws to
the GPU (`MFront`) and associated data structures (`MGIS`). Note that
other HPC libraries is considered for the future, such as `CUDA`, `RAJA`
or `OCCA` for performance portability of MFEM/MGIS on GPU.

Release notes of Version 1.0.0
==============================

Version 1.0.0 has been released on February 8, 2024.


Short description
=================

- Support for multiple materials with distinct constitutive equations:

  - Micromorphic laws
  - Orthotropic laws
- Support for internal state variables (defined at integration points):

  - Use of ``MGIS`` data structures
  - Use of mechanical behavior laws generated by MFront
- Post-processing features for nonlinear mechanics:

  - ``ComputeResultantForceOnBoundary``: Compute the resultant of the inner forces on a boundary
  - ``ComputeMeanThermodynamicForcesValues``: Compute macroscopic stress and strain for each material
  - ``ParaviewExportIntegrationPointResultsAtNodes``: Generate Paraview post-processing files with internal state variables using MGIS
- Flexible C++ API for defining ``MFEM`` simulation features
- CI workflow with examples in `test` and 58% coverage

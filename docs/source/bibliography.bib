	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Licos fuel performance code which has been developed for several years within the platform pleiades, co-developed by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission ({CEA}) and its industrial partners Électricité de France ({EDF}) and {AREVA}.

{CEA} engineers have been using Licos to back multidimensional thermo-mechanical studies on innovative fuel elements design and experimental device pre-and post-irradiation computations. Studies made with Licos thus encompass a wide range of situations, including most nuclear systems used or studied in France in recent years ({PWR}, {SFR} or {GFR}), normal and off-normal operating conditions, and a large selection of materials (either for fuel, absorber, coolant and cladding).

The aim of this paper is to give some insights about some innovative features in the design of Licos (dependency management, kriging, mfront, etc.). We also present two studies that demonstrate the flexibility of this code. The first one shows how Licos can be combined with the Germinal monodimensional fuel performance code to demonstrate the interest of a three dimensional modelling of the fuel relocation phenomenon in the Sodium Fast Reactor fuel pin. The second one describes how Licos was used to model the {DIAMINO} experiment.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a modular formulation and computational implementation of a class of anisotropic plasticity models at finite strains based on incremental minimization principles. The modular kinematic setting consists of a constitutive model in the logarithmic strain space that is framed by a purely geometric pre- and postprocessing. On the theoretical side, the point of departure is an a priori six-dimensional approach to finite plasticity based on the notion of a plastic metric. In a first step, a geometric preprocessor defines a total and a plastic logarithmic strain measure obtained from the current and the plastic metrics, respectively. In a second step, these strains enter in an additive format a constitutive model of anisotropic plasticity that may have a structure identical to the geometrically linear theory. The model defines the stresses and consistent tangents work-conjugate to the logarithmic strain measure. In a third step these objects of the logarithmic space are then mapped back to nominal, Lagrangian or Eulerian objects by a geometric postprocessor. This geometric three-step-approach defines a broad class of anisotropic models of finite plasticity directly related to counterparts of the geometrically linear theory. It is specified to a model problem of anisotropic metal plasticity. On the computational side we develop an incremental variational formulation of the above outlined constitutive structure where a quasi-hyperelastic stress potential is obtained from a local constitutive minimization problem with respect to the internal variables. It is shown that this minimization problem is exclusively restricted to the logarithmic strain space in a structure identical to the small-strain theory. The minimization problem determines the internal state of the material for finite increments of time. We develop a discrete formulation in terms of just one scalar parameter for the amount of incremental flow. The existence of the incremental stress potential provides a natural basis for the definition of the geometric postprocessor based on function evaluations. Furthermore, the global initial-boundary-value-problem of the elastic–plastic solid appears in the incremental setting as an energy minimization problem. Numerical examples show that the results obtained are surprisingly close to those obtained by a reference framework of multiplicative plasticity.},
